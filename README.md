# Store Games Website

## Description
In this repository I created a web project named "Store Games" with 5 Games in it. These games are :
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Rock-Paper-Scissors
3. Dinosaur (Chrome Dino)
4. Snake
5. Ping-Pong

By default user is sent on home page , where every page has an header menu and content of the page.
The website has a user login-system. To access the games you have to create an account to this website. To create you have access to Sing-Up(create a user) and Log-In page.
Header menu is different for the moment when user is logged and not. When usser is logged he has access to two pages Library and Store.
In Store user can buy a game(very are only 5) and in Library is showing the games which user has bought. User has two option in Library page to play the game and to sell the game.
Every games has own price and by default when is user create an account he receives 50 points.
In Snake game exists a LeaderBoard where is printing top 10 playes in descending order who made most points.
